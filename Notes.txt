**************THE STEPS I FOLLOWED TO CREATE THE APPLICATION****************

- STARTING WITH THE APPLICATION CONCEPTION

- CREATING THE PROJECT STRUCTURE AND ADDING THE NECESSARY DEPENDECIES

- CREATING THE ENTITIES

- ASSIGNING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE ENTITIES FOLLOWING THE CONCEPTIONS

- ADDING THE NECESSARY METHODS IN THE OWNING SIDE OF THE RELATIONSHIP ( ADDING ROLES TO A USER / ASSIGNING A COIURSE TO A STUDENT ...Â°

- CREATING THE DAO AND AADING THE QUERY METHODS THAT WE NEED TO USE IN THE SERVICE LAYER

- MODIFYING THE APPLICATIONS.PROPERTIES FILE TO CONNECT TO THE DATABASE

- TESTING THE CRUD OPERATIONS WITH THE OPERATIONUTILITY CLASS AND USING THE DAOS AND THE LOGIC METHODS

-   AFTER TESTING THE CRUD OPERATIONS WITH THE OPERATIONUTILITY CLASS , WE WILL BE TESTING THE CRUD OPERATIONS WITH THE API.
-When we were using the OperationUtility class, we tested our CRUD  operations without API , and the return type of the DAO classes was a list ,
but , if we need to make a pagination in the front end application , we need another type   other than the list , which is the Page type ,
so we need to change the return type of the DAO classes to be Page type so that we can  the result in pages , we insert the size and the page number.
A s a result , we will be getting a list of courses with .size with the sizer we specified as well as the page number which was sent in the request as an arguement .

- CREATING THE DTOs AND THE MAPPERS TO CONVERT THE ENTITIES TO THE DTOs AND VICE VERSA
We use DTOs(to directly  select what will be sent to the front end application )  to transfer the data between the front end and the back end , and we use the mappers to convert the entities to the DTOs and vice versa.
For example , the front end applications , sends a request to the back end to get the list of courses , the back end will get the list of courses from the database , and then it will convert the list of courses to a list of courseDTOs and then it will send the list of courseDTOs to the front end application.
Or the front end appliction sends the DTOs as an input , then we convert it into the entity using the help of the mappers
NOTE : DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) often include only getters and setters to keep them simple and focused on data transfer

- CREATING THE SERVICE LAYER AND ADDING THE BUSINESS LOGIC METHODS
How to Decide: DAO vs Service
Question	Answer: DAO or Service?
Does it involve basic CRUD or direct queries?	DAO
Does it combine multiple database operations?	Service
Does it manage relationships between entities?	Service
Does it implement business rules/validations?	Service
Is it reusable across multiple business operations?	DAO
Does it modify an entity or its relationships?	Service

- Creating a runner class to test the services

- Creating the Controllers
